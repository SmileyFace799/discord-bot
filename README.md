<h1>My discord bot :D</h1>
<p>
This repository is the source code for my discord bot.

The code is designed to be easily runnable on any bot account that has a stored token file.
A token file is a plain text file with a bot token inside of it.

</p>
<h2>Setup Guide:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download a <a href="https://github.com/SmileyFace799/discord-bot/releases">release</a> of the bot</li>
<li>Put the downloaded .jar / source code inside a designated bot folder</li>
<li>Create a folder named "tokens" (case sensitive)</li>
<li>Inside the newly created folder, create a text file named "{...}.token". Make sure the name is in all lowercase</li>
<li>Open the newly created token file, and paste the bot's token inside of it.</li>
<li>Go back to the designated bot folder, and create a text file named "activeBot.txt" (case sensitive)</li>
<li>Open the newly created text file, and paste the name of the token file that should be used when starting the bot,
without the ".token" file extension (case insensitive)</li>
<li>If done correctly, the bot is now runnable. Upon running, it should print "{BOT_NAME} is ready" in the console</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> For release 1.0.0, the token file name in "activeBot.txt" is case sensitive.</p>
